# fish-shield

This system forms a special sequence of short high voltage pulses at electrodes immersed into water to drive fish away from an industrial water intake in a natural reservoir. Its control unit is operated with a 16Ã—2 character LCD panel and control buttons. The high voltage unit and the control unit communicate via UART (RS-485).
